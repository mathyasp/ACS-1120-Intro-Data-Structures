# ACS-1120 Intro to Data Structures and Algorithms
## Tweet Generator

### Project Description
- Use a Python script to randomly generate words from a dictionary.
- Build sentences by sampling these words using a Markov language model.
- Implement grammar rules parsed from the text of a large document set.
- Build data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues, and heaps to store the words and sentences.
- Analyze the inner workings and performance tradeoffs of each data structure.
- Deploy your language model to a Flask web server on Heroku and connect it to Twitter to let users tweet their favorite results.

### Learning Outcomes
- master Python data structures and data processing algorithms
- implement data structures including linked lists, hash tables, stacks, queues and heaps
- parse text documents and store information in data structures
- implement sampling methods and Markov chains on data sets
